    composer require pyxl/core:^1.0.0
    bin/magento module:enable Pyxl_Core

    bin/magento module:enable Pyxl_MarketoWidget
    bin/magento setup:upgrade
    bin/magento cache:clean 
    
    
## Settings
You will need to setup a few settings before using these widgets. 
* Navigate to **Stores** -> **Configuration** -> **Pyxl** ->  **Marketo Settings**
* In *Base URL* insert the base URL for your subscription. This can typically be found in the embed code. 
* In *Munchkin ID* insert your subscription Munchkin ID. 

## Widget
To use the widget use the Insert Widget function on any CMS Block or Page and choose **Marketo Form**. In the popup
put the Form ID in the field and save. Your form should populate when testing (after clearing cache).
